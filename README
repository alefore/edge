Edge - A text editor.

1. Introduction

Edge is a text editor and terminal handler.  It uses the notion of "buffers" to
represent open files or the output of a program (which might still be running,
and which might have a terminal of its own).  As its extension language, Edge
uses a subset of C++.

Edge is under active development and many of its bindings and/or general
interface is likely to change soon.

This document describes the use of Edge.  Edge is an editor with multiple modes,
where commands are typically executed by typing their associated character
sequences.  These sequences are given in this document between quotes.


2. Running Edge

If you run Edge on a file, it will open it and display it:

  $ edge README.txt

Inside Edge, you can get help typing "?" (and "a?" for advanced commands).

You can quit at any time with "aq" (short for "Advanced > Quit").


3. Navigating a buffer


3.1 Basic navigation

The cursor will start at the beginning of the file.  You can use "h", "j", "k",
"l" or the arrow keys to move it around.

3.2 Search for a regular expression

You can search for a string with "/": Edge will prompt you for a regular
expression to search for and pressing Enter will take you to its first match
after the current cursor position.

Search supports autocompletion, where hitting Tab will replace the current
regular expression by the longest common prefix of its next 10 matches
(configurable through variable xxx, see section 7).  Press Tab once again to
display a buffer with the list of matches.

To repeat a search, use the SEARCH structure (section 6.1).

If the WORD structure (section 6.1) is enabled, Edge will not prompt you for a
regular expression: it will, instead, just search for the current word.

To search backwards, use the Reverse modifier (section 6.3).


3.3. Search for a character

You can search for a character with "f": this will take you to the next
occurrence of the next character you type.  This is roughly equivalent to typing
"/", entering a character and pressing Enter.

To search backwards, use the Reverse modifier (section 6.3).


3.4. History of positions

Edge keeps a history of the positions in which you've been.  You can go back to
the previous position with "b".

4. Editing a buffer


4.1. Inserting characters


4.2. Deleting characters


4.3. Pasting characters


4.4. Undo & Redo


4.5. Repeating the last command


5. Buffers

5.1. List of buffers

Press "al" at any time to open a buffer that contains the list of buffers.  Each
line in this buffer represents a buffer: an open file or the output of a
subprocess (which may be running or may have already exited).

5.2. Reload a buffer

5.3. Run a command

5.4. Open a file

5.5. Close a buffer


6. Structures & structure modifiers

6.1. Logical structures

6.2. Structure modifiers

6.3. Reverse modifier


7. Variables
