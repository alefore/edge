Review task: Focus on avoiding bad comments. Only issue suggestions that are related to avoiding useless verbose comments. Comments should only be added when they add significant value to the code, which typically happens when they explain *why* something is structured a certain way.

## Example: Bad comments:

These comments are bad, because they don't really add any information to what the code already says:

    import os  # Added import

    # Iterate the list of elements
    for i in elements:
      ...
