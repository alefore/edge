-- Display

Show that a line is longer than a given width.
  Should be based on a config variable that sets the text width.

Handle lines longer than the screen width?

Handle unicode.

-- Editing

Reflow a paragraph?  How to detect the prefix?

Handle DELETE key

Implement delete of page/word.

-- Navigation

Add a way to repeat the last search.

Add a "forward" command (perhaps "B") that undoes the current "back" command.

-- Commands

When the flags of a file changes, update the list of buffers if it's shown.

Have a way to fork a command running whatever is in the current line?
  Maybe as part of af?
    CHAR> prompt (as before)
    LINE> run line
    BUFFER> run a command for each line

Figure out why "python" doesn't work very interactively.
  Canonical test: create a "python" buffer and give it some "help(list)" or similar, it should do it.

When running subcommands with aC, actually set variables "ARG0", "ARG1", "ARG2", "ARG3", with words in line...

Create some "barriers" that limit the number of subprocesses.  Set a limit for each.  Maybe as a special type of buffer?  Let it reload to show the state?
  Commands should by default go against a shared barrier, but should have a variable that specifies what barrier to use.

-- Variables

Save the contents of the history and variables?

Allow configuration files to specify variables for buffers (by various criteria)

Let commands inherit variables from their parent.

Add a variable for specifying which characters should be considered parts of a path?
  Then use that to find the current path in the current line.
  Then set that for c++ files so that #include "local_file.cc" works.
