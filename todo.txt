-- Display

-- Editing

When an anonymous buffer is saved, ask for the name?

Handle DELETE key

Implement delete of page.

Add tests for Undo for insert.

-- Navigation

Add a "margin_lines" integer variable.
  Scroll the file automatically to always keep that number of entries visible above/below cursor.
    Unless at the beginning/end.
  Also "margin_columns", consistent.

Add a boolean variable "highlight_current_line" (default: false); when set, highlight the line with the current cursor position.

-- Prompt

Support ARROW_LEFT, allow editing characters other than the last one.

-- Commands

Improve "af":
  Add more structures to "af":
    BUFFER> run a command with the whole contents of the buffer
      (another possibility: run a command for each line in buffer (prompt))
  Handle repetitions?  Maybe for line, run multiple lines in separate buffers?

When running subcommands with aC, actually set variables "ARG0", "ARG1", "ARG2", "ARG3", with words in line...

Create some "barriers" that limit the number of subprocesses.  Set a limit for each.  Maybe as a special type of buffer?  Let it reload to show the state?
  Commands should by default go against a shared barrier, but should have a variable that specifies what barrier to use.

-- Variables

Save the contents of variables?  Maybe in a per-buffer file?

-- VM

Add support for templates, so that we can do "vector<string>".

-- Misc

When running nested edge on a file, pass its absolute path to the parent.

Allow running a nested edge sending a c++ (extension) command to the parent.

Support variables scoped at the Editor level (i.e. not specific to a given buffer).

Add a variable to set the exit status?
  Should probably be an int, default to 0.
  Maybe add a quick way of setting it to -1? "aE"?
