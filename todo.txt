-- Display

Handle unicode.

-- Editing

When an anonymous buffer is saved, ask for the name?

Handle DELETE key

Implement delete of page.

Support autocomplete while editting a buffer
  Maybe initially just look up words in the current file?
  Maybe variables control sources of completions?

Add tests for Undo for insert.

Implement replace mode.

-- Navigation

Add a "margin_lines" integer variable.
  Scroll the file automatically to always keep that number of entries visible above/below cursor.
    Unless at the beginning/end.
  Also "margin_columns", consistent.

-- Prompt

Support ARROW_LEFT, allow editing characters other than the last one.

-- Commands

Improve "af":
  Add more structures to "af":
    BUFFER> run a command with the whole contents of the buffer
      (another possibility: run a command for each line in buffer (prompt))
  Handle repetitions?  Maybe for line, run multiple lines in separate buffers?

When running subcommands with aC, actually set variables "ARG0", "ARG1", "ARG2", "ARG3", with words in line...

Create some "barriers" that limit the number of subprocesses.  Set a limit for each.  Maybe as a special type of buffer?  Let it reload to show the state?
  Commands should by default go against a shared barrier, but should have a variable that specifies what barrier to use.

Add a way to start a command, like with flags.

-- Variables

Save the contents of variables?  Maybe in a per-buffer file?

-- VM

-- Misc

Add a variable to set the exit status?
  Should probably be an int, default to 0.
  Maybe add a quick way of setting it to -1? "aE"?
